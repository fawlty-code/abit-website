            behavioural insights team, operating out of Ashoka University, affiliated and funded by
            the Centre for Social and Behaviour Change (CSBC). \n
            We study all things B-Sci - policy, well-being, pop culture, consumer behaviour,
            organisational structures, business design and pretty much anything else under the
            sun. As a student-led organisation, we aim to explore and apply the many facets of
            behavioural science and interdisciplinary research to our every-day surroundings, and
            drive impactful change</div>
